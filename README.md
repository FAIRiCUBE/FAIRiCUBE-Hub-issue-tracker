# FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker
This Repo provides a central point for FAIRiCUBE issues.

In addition, an [Example Files](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/tree/main/Example%20Files) folder has been created to store examples that we want to reference from issues, but don't have a storage location (TEAMs is not good as goes across technology)
