# Policy Briefs
In our Sibling coordination meeting, we agreed to work jointly on policy briefs, in the hope of making a stronger impact together.
As none of us are experts on this, we're collecting examples and guidelines here.

- Biodiversa website [policy briefs](https://www.biodiversa.eu/actionable-knowledge/policy-briefs/) 
- Conveniently, Biodiversa also has a [guide to writing policy briefs](https://www.biodiversa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/annex1_practical-method.pdf) 
- IIASA Policy Brief on "[The future of biodiversity monitoring in Europe](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/blob/main/PolicyBriefs/PB37_Biodiversity_WEBnew.pdf)"
- ENVISION Policy Brief "[Towards an Inclusive Global Biodiversity Framework](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker/blob/main/PolicyBriefs/Policy-Brief-Inclusive-Conservation-fall-2020.pdf)"
